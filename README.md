# Blob's World
Simple and basic 2D platformer game built on UnityEngine.

# Description
The main objective is to solve every level by reaching the finish door and collecting coins and eggs along the way. As the player progress through the levels, the difficulty starts increasing. There are only five levels. This is just a proof of concept, there may be bugs and glitches and so ignore those.
